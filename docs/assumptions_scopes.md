### Assumptions & Scope

#### **Assumptions**
* **Assumption 1:** We assume all Excel files contain a **common key** (e.g., `Lot_ID`) that allows for relational mapping, even if the column names and key formats slightly differ.
* **Assumption 2:** Instead of a live database, we assume the Excel files represent the **"Source of Truth"** (simulating an export from an older ERP system).

---

#### **In Scope**
* **Identifying** whether the same defect type appears across multiple lots over time.
* **Distinguishing** recurring defect issues from one-off incidents.
* **Aggregating** inspection data across daily and weekly inspection logs.
* **Excluding** non-defect inspection records (e.g., `Qty Defects = 0`) from defect occurrence counts.
* **Indicating** when available data is insufficient to determine recurrence.

---

#### **Out of Scope**
* Root cause analysis of defects.
* Predictive or AI-based quality analysis.
* Real-time inspection or production monitoring.
* Enforcement of data correctness at the source (e.g., preventing bad Excel entries).
* User authentication, authorization, or role-based access control.
* The dashboard needs to be functional and clean, but **not** a "pixel-perfect" consumer-grade design.
